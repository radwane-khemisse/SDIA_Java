# POO in Java - TP

This repository is dedicated to the assignments for the Object-Oriented Programming (POO) module in Java. Here, I will be providing my solutions, explanations, and code implementations for the exercises and tasks given in the POO course.

## Overview

The assignments in this module aim to strengthen understanding of core OOP concepts in Java, including but not limited to:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Collections and Data Structures**
- **File I/O and Streams**

## Structure

Each assignment will be organized in a dedicated folder with the following structure:

- `TPX/` (Where `X` is the assignment number)
    - **Code files**: Java code for the assignment
    - **README**: Brief explanation of the  assignment
